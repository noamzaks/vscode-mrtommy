# Mr. Tommy VSCode Extension

The Tommy VSCode extension allows rapid development of Motion Planning algorithms.

## Features

Motion profile scenes can be edited inside VSCode with a **live** preview panel. Simply use a `.scene.json` file extension and you'll get JSON validation for your scene, and use the "Preview Scene" command to open a preview panel for the scene you're currently editing.

## Acknowledgements

Mr. Tommy and the VSCode extension are both **heavily** inspired by [discopygal](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~cgl/discopygal/docs/index.html), although it aims to provide a different experience.
